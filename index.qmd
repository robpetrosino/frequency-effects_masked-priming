  This study addresses the controversy surrounding whether masked repetition priming is sensitive to word frequency, the Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE). Early findings suggested no such interaction, but recent studies have contradicted this. This uncertainty is consequential, as word recognition models differ in whether they predict this effect, and how they account for it in case it does exist. In two experiments employing very large sample sizes (Ns=2600), we show that the FAE does occur in masked conditions. In experiment 1, we observed a FAE of 10ms with a short prime duration (33ms). In experiment 2, we replicate and extended this finding with a longer prime duration (50ms). While the magnitude of the repetition priming effects increased with prime duration, the FAE remained constant. We contend that no word recognition model can currently account for this pattern of results, but the entry-opening model may be modified to accommodate these findings.
