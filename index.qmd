  This study investigates the controversy surrounding the sensitivity of masked repetition priming to word frequency, the so called Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE). Many early findings suggested no such interaction, but more recent studies have contradicted this. In experiment 1, we provide evidence that the FAE does occur under masked conditions, with a short prime duration (33ms). In experiment 2, we replicate this finding with a longer prime duration (50ms), and show that the magnitude of the FAE is independent of prime duration. We contend that, while no word recognition models can currently account for this pattern of results, there may be possible modifications to the entry-opening model that might render it able to accommodate our set of results.
