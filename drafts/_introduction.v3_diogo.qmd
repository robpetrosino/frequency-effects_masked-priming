Visual word recognition is a complex cognitive function, as written words engage various visual and linguistic processes and, in the case of fluent readers, do so in a remarkably fast and accurate manner. Among many tools that have been developed to study visual word recognition, one of the most influential is masked priming. Initially developed to help disentangle automatic and episodic contributions to priming in lexical decision tasks [@ForsterDavis1984], the masked priming procedure has since proved valuable to uncover the conditions under which orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic information impact access to visual word forms, by mitigating strategic effects and minimizing the influence of controlled processes [@Forster1998, for review]. The masked priming procedure generally involves a forward mask (i.e., usually a string of hashes, #####), followed by a prime string presented in lowercase for very short time $SOA < 60$ ms), and a target string presented in uppercase immediately after (*#####* - *prime* - *TARGET*) to which participants are expected to respond. Because the prime presentation is so brief and masked by preceding and subsequent stimuli, most participants report not being aware that a prime string has been presented, and can at most report a screen flicker just before the target presentation [cf. @ForsterEtal2003; @Nievas2010]. 

One of the most robust findings in the masked priming literature is the *repetition priming effect*: when the prime and target are the same string (albeit in a different case, e.g., *word-WORD*), the response to the target is facilitated compared to when the same target is preceded by an unrelated prime (e.g., *phone-WORD*). The fact that the size of masked repetition priming effect is proportional to the duration of the prime [@ForsterEtal2003; @Angele2023] has led some researchers to posit that the masked repetition priming effect reflects a type of "head start" in the processing of the target. In *Interactive-Activation* (IA) models [@McClellandRumelhart1981; @GraingerJacobs1996; @ColtheartEtal2001], this "head start" is conceived of as increased activation of the target entry as a function of its prior activation during the presentation of the prime. These raised activation levels in turn help the entry reach the recognition threshold faster. Alternatively, *search models* like the *entry opening model* [cf. @ForsterEtal2003] posit an *entry opening time* (EOT) that is uniform across lexical items. In this model, the target's EOT is entirely or partially saved due to the fact that the entry opening process is effectively initiated during the presentation of the prime. Finally, *retrospective models* of priming, such as the *memory recruitment model* [@BodnerMasson1997; @MassonBodner2003; @Bodner2014], posit a non-lexical source for the masked repetition priming effect. Under this view, masked repetition priming stems from the exploitation, at post-access stages, of a memory resource created by the encounter with the prime word.

## Does frequency interact with repetition in masked priming?

The masked repetition effect is a robust finding, but there is still considerable uncertainty about whether lexical frequency impacts masked priming. In unmasked contexts, it is well established that high-frequency words often benefit less from repetition than low-frequency words [*frequency attenuation effect*, henceforth FAE\; @ScarboroughEtal1977]. The precise *locus* of this effect, however, remains the topic of debate. Three types of models have attempted to explain the FAE in different ways.

*IA* models [@McClellandRumelhart1981; @GraingerJacobs1996] capture the FAE by positing that once a word is recognized, it takes time for its activation levels to return to their normal resting state. If the same word is then encountered again while still highly activated, it will cross the recognition threshold much faster compared to when it is at its usual resting activation levels. Alternatively, these models could also propose that each access creates a small but long-term change in the resting activation levels of the lexical node, and so prior exposure will always lead to some amount of priming. The FAE arises in this type of model because low frequency words are hypothesized to have a much lower resting activation level compared to high frequency words. Thus, any increase activation level will benefit low frequency words more compared to high frequency words [cf. @GraingerEtal2012].

*Search models* like the *entry opening model* [@ForsterDavis1984], on the other hand, predict that candidate entries for recognition are evaluated according to their rank order of frequency. Because this is a relatively stable property of the lexical system, it is unlikely to radically change based on one or even a few entry accesses. Thus, these models predict that the FAE must have a different source that is not lexical. In this, they agree with *retrospective models* [e.g., @Jacoby1981; @Jacoby1983; @BodnerMasson1997; @MassonBodner2003; @Bodner2014], according to which it is the activation/retrieval of the episodic memory trace of the encounter with the prime word that is responsible for facilitating the behavioral response; the FAE under this view stems from the independently established fact that low-frequency words exhibit an advantage in episodic memory tasks [like *old-new* tasks\;  @ScarboroughEtal1977]. Thus, a direct prediction of this view would be that, if it were possible to minimize episodic influences, then no FAE should be expected. @ForsterDavis1984 proposed that masking the priming stimulus could achieve this effect, adapting the procedure of @EvettHumphreys1981. Across six experiments, @ForsterDavis1984 established that no FAE arises when the primes are effectively masked, corroborating their prediction that, being a post-lexical, episodic memory effect, the FAE should only be observed when the primes are fully visible and their context is somehow relevant for the behavioral decision to the target. This finding has since often been replicated [@ForsterEtal1987; @SeguiGrainger1990; @Sereno1991; @ForsterDavis1991; @RajaramNeely1992; @BodnerMasson1997; @ForsterEtal2003; @Nievas2010, @Norris2018].

However, as @tbl-litReview shows, there are, contrary to the earlier literature, a number of studies that do report significant FAEs in masked repetition priming [@BodnerMasson2001; @Kinoshita2006; @NorrisKinoshita2008; @Nievas2010; @Wu2012]. @BodnerMasson2001 argues that when the processing of stimuli is made harder by an alternating case presentation (e.g., *pHoNe*), the associated increase in difficulty to perform the lexical decision generates an extra incentive to draw on the memory resource created by the brief processing of the prime. Under such conditions, they were able to observe a statistically significant FAE, as predicted by their *memory recruitment* model. @Kinoshita2006 noticed that in earlier studies the low frequency words often had very high error rates, and suggested that perhaps many participants did not know them. If participants treated a substantial number of low frequency words as nonwords, and nonwords do not exhibit repetition priming under masked conditions, it could artificially depress the repetition priming effect for the low frequency condition, which could make any existing FAE harder to detect. In two separate experiments, @Kinoshita2006 showed that larger repetition priming effects for low frequency words were only obtained when the low frequency words were vetted to make sure the participants knew them prior to the experiment. Following up on @Kinoshita2006, @NorrisKinoshita2008 were also able to find an interaction between lexical frequency and repetition in masked repetition priming, as were @Wu2012 (exp. 5) and  @Nievas2010 in Spanish (exp. 1B).

This uneven pattern of findings is puzzling. However, as @tbl-litReview shows [see also @Kinoshita2006], it is noteworthy that 17 out of 20 previous experiments showed numerically larger masked priming effects for low frequency words as opposed to high frequency words, irrespective of statistical significance. Similarly, the average repetition effect for low frequency words in the studies reviewed in @tbl-litReview is 15 ms larger when compared to that of high frequency words.

In summary, it is somewhat surprising that the status of the FAE in masked priming remains largely unresolved in the literature, given its non-negligible average magnitude across studies and its theoretical significance in elucidating the underlying cognitive processes of masked priming. The experiments reported here were designed put on firmer empirical footing whether frequency attenuation effects can be observed under masked priming, as well as whether such an effect is sensitive to the duration of the prime, which can help distinguish between competing frameworks of visual word recognition.

## Our studies

One potential contributor to past discrepancies about the existence of the FAE in masked priming is the overreliance on the dated @KuceraFrancis1967 word frequency database, which 15 out of 20 experiments have depended on. This frequency database has consistently demonstrated inferior predictive performance in psycholinguistic experiments, particularly with low-frequency words, compared to more contemporary databases [@Burgess1998; @Zevin2002; @Balota2004; @BrysbaertNew2009; @Yap2009; @Brysbaert2011; @Gimenes2016; @Herdaugdelen2017; @Brysbaert2018]. 

Another factor that might have contributed to the conflicting past findings is the potential underpowered nature of many previous studies, as already noted by other researchers [@BodnerMasson1997; @BodnerMasson2001; @MassonBodner2003; @Adelman2014]. This is a reasonable concern, as interaction effects like the FAE often require larger sample sizes for reliable detection compared to main effects [@PotvinSchtuz2000; @BrysbaertStevens2018]. Our literature review revealed crucial gaps in the reporting of relevant statistical information, which impedes the assessment of the statistical power attained by past experiments. The inconsistent reporting of standard deviations (in only 7 out of 20 experiments) and the complete absence of reporting of the correlation structure between conditions complicates power assessments. Researchers are thus forced to explore a range of plausible values for standard deviations and correlation structures on their own. In our own simulations (full details in supplementary material) the results reported in @tbl-litReview reveal a wide range of possible statistical power attained by previous studies, depending solely on the combination of plausible standard deviation and correlation across conditions. For instance, the study with the smallest sample size [@ForsterEtal1987, _N_=16] had between 2% and 24% chance of detecting a 15 ms frequency attenuation effect and a 4% to 84% chance to detect a 30 ms effect. Similarly, the study with the largest sample size [@Wu2012, $N=64$] exhibited a range of 4% to 87% power to detect a 15 ms FAE, and 12% to 100% for a 30 ms effect. As a consequence of the limited reporting of relevant statistical information in past studies, it is nearly impossible to determine if any of them were adequately powered to detect the effect of interest.

The potential of a non-negligible number of low-powered experiments on the scientific record may play a role in accounting for the uneven pattern of results reported thus far. First, if low-powered experiments are prevalent, it increases the risk of observed statistically significant effects being spurious [@Button2013]. At face value, only 6 out of 20 experiments report a statistically significant FAE; and two of these employed a unique alternating-case stimulus presentation [@BodnerMasson2001; @MassonBodner2003]. While reporting non-significant FAEs, the remaining 14 studies still exhibit numerically larger repetition effect sizes for low-frequency words compared to high-frequency words. The observed pattern is difficult to reconcile with the purported absence of interaction between frequency and masked repetition priming. The average FAE across all studies stands at 15 ms, a non-negligible effect size, which, under the naïve assumption that the two conditions are similar enough across experiments, seem to be statistically significant: *M_FAE* = 15 ms, *CI_95%* = [8 21]), *t*(20) = 4.89, $p=.0001$. These considerations suggest that a genuine FAE may indeed exist in masked priming, but might be smaller than the magnitudes that are statistically detectable in most previous experiments. This interpretation is supported by the results from @Adelman2014 in a large scale, multi-site lab-based study on orthographic priming. They report a small but reliable FAE, but caution this effect could simply be an orthographic neighborhood effect masquerading as a frequency effect, due to the high correlations between the two variables. The absence of clarity regarding the statistical power of previous research poses challenges in assessing the likelihood of these significant findings being spurious.

Second, it is widely acknowledged that experiments with approximately 50% power are akin to a coin toss in their ability to detect a true effect [@Cohen1992]. A less-appreciated fact is that, in the presence of even lower power ($<25%$), statistically significant results can substantially overestimate the effect size -- a type-M error [@GelmanCarlin2014]. When power drops to levels below 10%, a statistically significant result may occur even when the observed effect goes in the opposite direction of the true effect -- a type-S error [@GelmanCarlin2014]. Our power simulations for within-subjects data revealed a similar relationship between statistical power, type-M, and type-S errors in line with the observations detailed by @GelmanCarlin2014 for the independent samples case. For instance, at 10% power (a possibility for virtually all previous studies, as indicated in @tbl-litReview), a statistically significant result could indicate an overestimation of the magnitude of the frequency attenuation effect by a factor between 2 and 5, with up to a 5% chance of incorrectly determining the direction of the effect.

The two studies reported here were designed to mitigate these two major confounding issues: overreliance on the @KuceraFrancis1967 frequency counts, as well as the potential lack of statistical power in previous research. With respect to the first issue, we exclusively sourced materials from the SUBTLEX$_{US}$ database [@BrysbaertNew2009], which reflects more recent linguistic usage and offer better validation in behavioral experiments [e.g., @BrysbaertNew2009; @Yap2009; @Brysbaert2011; @Gimenes2016; @Herdaugdelen2017]. As for the second issue, we recruited two extremely large samples ($N=2600$) to achieve high statistical power for an interaction effect like the FAE (see supplementary materials) and narrow margins of error around the estimated effect size [@Maxwell2008].

## Web browser-based masked priming

Achieving the desired level of statistical power required a sample size that would be impractical to pursue in traditional lab settings, typically constrained by access to limited research computers and participant pools. In response to this challenge, the present studies were exclusively conducted online, leveraging the growing trend in online behavioral research facilitated by HTML5 capabilities and the availability of advanced web software such as *jsPsych* [@deLeeuw2014], *PsychoJS* [the JavaScript counterpart of *PsychoPy*, @PeirceEtal2019], *Gorilla* [@Anwyl2020], and *Labvanced* [@Labvanced2017].

![Meta-analysis of three recent masked priming experiments conducted online, together with unpublished pilot data from our lab, investigating three different phenomena: identity, morphological and semantic priming, at 33ms and 50ms prime durations.](./supplemental-data/online_maskedpriming_meta.png){#fig-meta fig-pos='H'}

Notably, three recent studies have already demonstrated the viability of conducting masked priming experiments online, employing different software tools: @Angele2023 with *PsychoJS*, @Cayado2023 with *Gorilla* and @PetrosinoEtal2023 with *Labvanced*. Crucially, a meta-analysis [@Bonett2009] of their results (@fig-meta; the full details are available in the supplemental material) show a clear replication of four basic benchmark results in masked priming: detection of (i) identity and (ii) morphological priming with (iii) no evidence of semantic priming, as well as (iv) a proportionality effect of identity priming and prime duration.

Building on these previous findings, experiment 1 attempts to determine whether frequency attenuation effects can be observed under masked priming. Experiment 2 focuses on whether frequency attenuation effects may vary as a function of prime duration.
