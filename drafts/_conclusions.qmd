The repetition priming response stands as a cornerstone in psycholinguistic investigations, offering insights into the mechanisms governing word recognition. An ongoing debate surrounds the interpretation of these effects, particularly concerning their source in the memory system. On the one hand, _interactive activation models_ [@McClellandRumelhart1981; @GraingerJacobs1996; @ColtheartEtal2001] posit a lexical source for repetition priming effects, either in terms of temporarily raised resting activation levels for lexical nodes in unmasked priming, or as a head start in the retrieval process in masked priming. _Episodic_ and _memory recruitment models_ [@Jacoby1981; @Jacoby1983;  @BodnerMasson1997; @MassonBodner2003; @Bodner2014] on the other hand, invoke a non-lexical source for the repetition effect, namely an episodic or episodic-like memory resource formed upon brief exposure to the prime word that can be recruited during the processing of the target item. Crucially, both models predict a single mechanism underlying masked and unmasked priming. Differential mechanisms between unmasked and masked repetition priming, however, are predicted by the _entry-opening model_ [@ForsterDavis1984], which propose both lexical and episodic sources of priming effects.

Thus, the existence of qualitatively distinct outcomes in masked and unmasked priming presented a direct challenge to some, but not all of these models. One such finding is the *Frequency Attenuation Effect* (FAE), in which higher frequency words exhibit smaller repetition effects compared to lower frequency words. The FAE has been described as observable only in unmasked priming since the work of @ForsterDavis1984, who demonstrated that when the prime word is presented very briefly (SOA $<$ 60 ms), it becomes masked by the target word, and this is hypothesized to prevent the conscious encoding of the prime. Under such conditions, the FAE purportedly disappears. @ForsterDavis1984 argued that this potentially shows that the FAE is subserved by a different type of memory source (perhaps episodic) than the masked repetition priming response. This conclusion, however, is the source of ongoing debates (see @tbl-litReview for review of past findings), which the two experiments reported here were meant to address.

Within this research landscape, our experiments targeting the frequency sensitivity of the repetition effect under masked conditions contribute methodological and theoretical insights. Methodologically, our results help establish the viability and reliability of online data collection for the masked priming paradigm, building on the work of @Angele2023, @Cayado2023 and @PetrosinoEtal2023.

In the same vein, the FAEs observed in experiments 1 and 2 have important theoretical ramifications. The historical belief that FAE fails to obtain in masked priming arose from a lack of statistically significant results. These were possibly rooted in the reliance of outdated frequency corpora by earlier experiments or inadequate statistical power to detect plausible effect sizes. Our design addressed these concerns, yielding statistically significant FAE results aligning with the literature's average effect (see @tbl-litReview; the 95% CI implies that the FAE is unlikely to be larger than 13 ms with a 33 ms prime duration). These results challenge the supposed qualitative distinction between masked and unmasked repetition priming cleaved by the FAE, complicating the rejection of single-mechanism theories, and suggesting that _interactive-activation models_ and _memory recruitment models_ may yet offer unifying explanations for masked and unmasked priming.

Similarly, our results also challenge the entry-opening model's prediction of the absence of FAE in masked priming. One potential way of dealing with this in the _entry opening model_ is to claim that masked priming severely reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the use of sources other than lexical memory [see @Forster1998; @ForsterEtal2003, for proposals along this line]. Alternatively, within the entry-opening model, the results of this study may be explained by the frequency-based mechanism occurring in the fast search stage. A potential mechanism in this direction was already hinted at by @ForsterDavis1984 themselves, and consists of a procedure, whereby during the fast search stage, the entry of a prime word is promoted to the top position of the search list. As a consequence, low-frequency words (which are fairly low in the search list) will benefit from such promotion procedure more than high-frequency words (which are instead already in higher positions), thus ultimately giving rise to the FAE.

While our findings present a compelling case for the presence of FAE in masked priming that is seemingly parallel to the unmasked case, questions about potential mechanistic differences persist. The larger sample size needed for masked FAEs raises intriguing considerations about the influence of memory sources and warrants further investigation. For example, there is independent evidence for different mechanisms in masked and unmasked repetition priming from RT distributional analyses (cf. @Gomez2013) that suggests that repetition priming under masked conditions affect primarily the encoding stage of the stimulus. Given that frequency is often associated with facilitation of encoding, our results could help support this view. Additionally, the trivially small inhibitory effect sizes of non-word masked repetition priming in experiments 1 and 2 align with the trend (overwhelmingly shown in the literature) that facilitatory effect may be exclusive to unmasked designs [@Forster1998; @ForsterEtal2003; but see @MassonBodner2003], and suggests avenues for future exploration.

Finally, the finding that the FAE occurs under masked priming conditions may impact our understanding of masked morphological priming. In this literature, there is a unresolved question about the ability of affixes to elicit masked morphological priming results [for a review, @AmentaCrepaldi2012]. In English, the evidence seems to indicate that only stems, but not affixes, have the ability to prime entries across the lexicon. This finding can and has been used to support models in which affixes are initially stripped before stems are accessed in the lexicon [@TaftForster1975; @ForsterAzuma2000; @StockallMarantz2006]. However, stems and affixes do also have a large frequency imbalance, with most affixes being substantially more frequent that most stems. The observation of FAE under masked priming can provide an alternative reason for why masked stem morphological priming is well attested but masked affix morphological priming is not: the latter could be due to a ceiling frequency attenuation effect. This is an intriguing possibility that must be left for future work to explore.

In summary, our study successfully replicated and expanded upon the work of @Angele2023, @Cayado2023 and @PetrosinoEtal2023, confirming the viability of observing repetition priming effects in masked priming experiments conducted online with a brief SOA of 33 ms. Notably, we addressed a lingering question in the literature by establishing the presence of the Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE) under masked conditions. The use of large online samples proved instrumental in overcoming the longstanding challenge of insufficient statistical power to detect interactions in factorial designs, which we believe had impeded previous investigations into detecting the FAE in masked priming.
