Establishing whether the FAE is observable in masked repetition priming is theoretically important, as different word recognition models make divergent predictions about whether the FAE should occur in masked priming, and, if it does, how it should be explained.

## Accounting for the FAE

On one side, *interactive activation* (IA) models [@McClellandRumelhart1981; @GraingerJacobs1996; @ColtheartEtal2001] and *retrospective models* of priming, such as the *memory recruitment model* [@BodnerMasson1997; @MassonBodner2003; @Bodner2014], predict the FAE in masked priming. However, these theories differ in where they locate the effect. *IA* models predict a lexical origin [see @GraingerEtal2012], while the memory recruitment model suggests a post-lexical source.

On the other side, *search models*, such as the *entry-opening model* [@ForsterDavis1984], propose a more complex interaction between lexical and episodic memory. Specially, this model posit that under unmasked conditions, repetition priming is driven largely by *episodic* memory, but under masked priming, *episodic* memory plays no role, and thus masked repetition priming reveals primarily *lexical* (and perhaps also *sublexical*) level processes. According to the *entry-opening model*, only two processes are at play within lexical structure: a frequency-ordered search and the time required to open an entry once a potential match is flagged (the *entry opening time*, EOT). The search is sensitive to word frequency, but the EOT is assumed to be uniform across all entries [and it is estimated at roughly 60 ms by @ForsterEtal2003]. Consequently, the model predicts no interaction between frequency and repetition priming under masked conditions, meaning the FAE should not be observable in masked repetition priming.

Clearly then, the FAE in experiments 1 and 2 empirically aligns with the predictions of *IA* and *memory recruitment* models, insofar as both models predict an FAE under masked conditions. These findings contradict the *entry opening model*, which predict no FAE in masked repetition priming.

However, further considerations suggest that the FAEs observed in our studies may be less supportive of the *memory recruitment model*, which predicts the FAE only when the context of the behavioral task justifies drawing on non-lexical memory resources post-lexically, such as when task difficulty is increased. In our experiments, task difficulty was deliberately minimized: both words and non-words had very high accuracy rates in the English Lexicon Project (\>90%, see @tbl-words), leading to item error rates that were never higher than 14%, entirely avoiding the need for item exclusions. In addition, only 58 in 5200 participants (1.1% of the total sample) had an overall error rate above 30%. Finally, many researchers may find implausible the assumption that episodic memory resources are formed at the very short prime duration used in experiment 1 (33 ms).

Conversely, the *entry-opening model* predicts a null FAE because it assumes a fixed EOT. This assumption, based on the observation that the magnitude of masked repetition effects mirror prime duration up to 60 ms [@ForsterEtal2003], is contradicted by our findings. In Experiment 2, where the prime duration was 50 ms, the maximum repetition priming effect was 35 ms, suggesting that EOTs are not fixed at 60 ms, nor do they match the prime duration in general [see @Wu2012 for a similar argument]. Moreover, repetition priming effects were consistently smaller for high-frequency words, further challenging the model's assumption of uniform EOTs. Thus, if we relax the assumption that EOTs are uniform across the lexicon and instead posit that lower-frequency words have longer entry opening times than higher-frequency words, the *entry-opening model*, like *IA* models, could account for the FAE.

## The independence of FAE from prime duration

What about the finding that the FAE does not seem to interact with prime duration? Here, all models seem to make the wrong predictions. *IA* models assume that it is stimulus exposure that drives activation of lexical nodes, and that frequency is directly related with lexical nodes activation levels, either in terms of setting their resting levels or in how fast they accumulate information from the input. @GraingerEtal2012 explains how the FAE is predicted by such a model: low-frequency words accumulate evidence more slowly that do high-frequency words. If one posits that stimulus repetition provide a uniform boost to lexical nodes, then compared to a situation where lexical nodes are at their resting activation levels (the unrelated condition), lower-frequency repeated words will reach their recognition threshold comparatively faster than would repeated high-frequency words [cf. @GraingerEtal2012, Fig. 1]. Under this view, however, the amount of activation boost to lexical nodes in the related condition is a function of stimulus exposure, and thus a longer prime duration should deliver a stronger initial activation boost, which can only lead to a magnification of the FAE (@fig-ia-2). Therefore, it seems that the basic mechanics of *IA* models, together with the assumptions that allow them to capture the FAE, also predict an interactive effect between FAE magnitude and prime duration, with larger FAE magnitudes predicted when prime durations are longer. In experiments 1 and 2, however, the increase from a 33ms to a 50ms prime duration elicited FAEs of same magnitude (approximately 10ms).

The original *entry opening model* does not predict a FAE, and so it cannot make any predictions about its potential interaction with prime duration. **(I think a logic step is missing here:) This is because the original model assumes the size of identity priming to amount to the EOT or prime duration (whichever is smaller), but should not be modulated by prime duration [@ForsterEtal2003; @Wu2012]. On the other hand, the modified version of the *entry opening model* sketched above would be able to. While still assuming that identity priming be equal to EOT or prime duration (whichever is smaller), the model we can be modified by arguing that the EOT is a function of word frequency. In this sense,** if the EOT is larger for lower-frequency words, then the relationship between prime duration and FAE is predicted to be somewhat non-linear (see @fig-eom-2). While prime duration equals the EOTs of the higher frequency words, and is therefore smaller than the EOTs of the lower frequency words, no FAE should be observed, **since the priming magnitude of both high- and low-frequency words should equally amount to the prime duration (@fig-eom-2, scenario A)**. While the prime duration exceeds the EOTs for the higher frequency words, but it is still shorter than the EOTs of the lower frequency words, the FAE should increase linearly with prime duration (@fig-eom-2, scenario B), and should reach its maximum when the prime duration equals the EOTs of the lower frequency words. Beyond that point, any increase in prime duration should no longer lead to increases in the FAE, which should remain at its maximum magnitude, namely the difference between the EOTs of high- and low-frequency words (@fig-eom-2, scenario C).

The size of the priming response to a word is argued to be equal to either the prime duration or the entry opening time (EOT) of the corresponding lexical entry, whichever is smaller. The interaction between prime duration and EOT of the prime word may trigger any of the three scenarios in panels A-C. The length of the black arrow graphically represents the length of the prime duration; the length and thickness of the text boxes represent the EOT for each word (shorter for high-frequency words such as *black*, and longer for low-frequency words such as *shark*).](./supplemental-data/fig-eom-2.jpg){#fig-eom-2 fig-pos="H"}

Unfortunately, we do not observe this predicted pattern in experiments 1 and 2. In experiment 1, the repetition effect for low-frequency words is close to the prime duration (a 28ms effect for a 33ms prime duration), while the repetition effect for high-frequency words is 10ms shorter (a 18ms effect for a 33ms prime duration). If we assume that the LF effect of 28 ms is not significantly different from the prime duration of 33 ms, our modified *entry opening model* would predict that the prime duration has not yet exceeded the *opening times* of the low frequency words, while it clearly has exceeded the *opening times* of the high-frequency words. Thus, the model just sketched would predict that an increase in prime duration would also increase the magnitude of the repetition effect for the LF condition, but not for the HF condition, leading to a larger FAE (@fig-eom-2, scenario B). However, while we did observe a 7ms increase in the magnitude of the repetition effect for the LF condition in experiment 2 ($MOP_{exp1}=28ms; MOP_{exp2}=35ms$), we also observed an 8ms increase for the HF condition ($MOP_{exp1}=18ms; MOP_{exp2}=26ms$), and a FAE that was virtually identical in magnitude across experiments ($FAE_{exp1}=10ms; FAE_{exp2}=9ms$). Conversely, if we take the results of experiment 1 at face value, and assume that the 33ms prime duration exceeds both the *opening times* of high- and low-frequency words (18 ms and 28 ms, respectively), then the modified *entry opening model* would indeed make the prediction that the FAE observed in experiment 1 reveals the maximum of the FAE as 10 ms, and that this value should not increase when prime duration increases (@fig-eom-2, scenario C). While this is what our experiments show, the same model would also make the prediction that the repetition priming effects should remain stable across experiments, contrary to fact (they are both approximately 8ms longer in experiment 2).

Thus, it seems neither *IA* models nor the modified *entry opening model* make the correct predictions about the pattern of results observed in experiments 1 and 2, namely a stable FAE effect irrespective of prime duration, with a concomitant increase in repetition priming effects as a function of it. *IA* models would have predicted an increased FAE in experiment 2, and the modified *entry opening model* would have predicted either an increased FAE in experiment 2, or exactly identical results in terms of FAE and repetition priming effects magnitudes in experiments 1 and 2.

Can these models be amended to allow them to capture the results? On the one hand, given their core mechanics, *IA* models can capture either a situation where FAE does not arise (i.e., word frequency is purely additive to repetition effects), or a situation where FAE is generated, and its magnitude is necessarily a function of the prime duration. Neither of these patterns match the results of experiments 1 and 2. So the results of experiment 1 and 2 pose a real challenge for *IA* models.

On the other hand, a different modification to the original *entry opening model* may help explain both the existence of the FAE and its non-interaction with prime duration. If we maintain the assumption that the EOT is uniform for all words, we could assume that the exposure to the prime raises the rank order of the target word to the top of the search list, thus resulting in a "promotion boost" that is a function of the repeated presentation, and should not interact with prime duration [along the lines of a direction that was already hinted at by @ForsterDavis1984]. This boost would also impact high- and low-frequency words differently: while both words would benefit from repetition by being raised to the top of the search list, low-frequency words would be retrieved comparatively faster than high-frequency words when contrasted with their first retrieval times during the presentation of the prime (see @fig-eom-3). This simple mechanism explains at once the existence of the FAE and the fact that it does not interact with prime duration. For instance, in experiment 1, the 10ms FAE can be explained as follows: as the EOT is uniform, then it must be around 18 ms (the repetition priming effect of high-frequency words). The repetition priming effect for low-frequency words (28 ms) is then the summation of the EOT (18 ms) and the comparative speed up difference in retrieval time for the target words across high- and low-frequency condition (i.e, the FAE, which is 10 ms with our set of materials).

![Graphic representation of an alternative modification of the entry opening model, in which the lexical entry of the prime stimulus is promoted to the top of the entry list in the entry opening stage. As being already relatively high in the list search, high-frequency prime words (such as *black*) may benefit from the promotion boost in a lesser extent as compared to low-frequency prime words (such as *shark*). The differential size of the relative promotion boost gives rise to the FAE.](./supplemental-data/fig-eom-3.jpg){#fig-eom-3 fig-pos="H"}

Unfortunately, this logic would fail to account for the results of experiment 2: if the EOT is indeed 18 ms as shown in experiment 1, and the EOT is the only additional source of priming for high-frequency words, then this effect is already maxed out with a prime duration of 33 ms. Why is it then that increasing the prime duration to 50 ms in experiment 2 makes the effect approximately 8ms longer (26 ms)? **One potential explanation for this may be that the EOTs may vary across samples of individuals, in line with a strand of the masked form priming research showing that priming covaries with the individual reading and spelling skills of the sample recruited [@AndrewsHersch2010; @AndrewsLo2012]. In our case, this would mean that the EOT for the sample in experiment 1 was 18 ms, but it was 26 ms for the sample in experiment 2, irrespective of the difference in the prime duration.** The problem with this claim is that it seems arbitrary to assume that the EOT can vary substantially (here \~8 ms) across our two very large samples, which are able to produce very narrow margins of errors around precise estimates for a number of relevant measurements, such as the mean and standard deviations RT for the unrelated conditions and non-word conditions and the magnitude of the FAE. Nonetheless, it may be a fruitful avenue for future studies to explore.

# Conclusions

Our study successfully replicated and expanded upon the work of @Angele2023, @Cayado2023 and @PetrosinoEtal2023, confirming the viability of observing repetition priming effects in masked priming experiments conducted online with both a short (33ms) and longer (50ms) priming durations. Notably, we were able to successfully address a lingering empirical question in the literature by establishing that the Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE) does arises under masked conditions. We were able to determine additionally that the FAE is also independent of the duration of the prime. We contend that, while this pattern of results presents a direct challenge to both *IA* and *entry opening* models, the latter offers a few promising avenues for small modifications might enable it to accommodate the results of our studies. The most promising is the assumption that after the encounter with the prime, its entry is temporarily raised to the top of the rank frequency ordered search list. This modification explains at once the existence of the FAE, and its independence of the prime duration.

**(Here's my attempt to add some general implications of the results of the study:) While our findings present a compelling case for the presence of FAE in masked priming that is seemingly parallel to the unmasked case, questions about potential mechanistic differences persist. First, the larger sample size needed to detected the masked FAE raises intriguing considerations about the influence of memory sources, and warrants further investigation. For example, there is independent evidence for different mechanisms in masked and unmasked repetition priming from RT distributional analyses that suggests that repetition priming under masked conditions affect primarily the encoding stage of the stimulus [@Gomez2013]. Given that frequency is often associated with facilitation of encoding, our results could help support this view. Additionally, the trivially small inhibitory effect sizes of non-word masked repetition priming in experiments 1 and 2 align with the trend (overwhelmingly shown in the literature) that facilitatory effect may be exclusive to unmasked designs [@Forster1998; @ForsterEtal2003; but see @MassonBodner2003], and suggests avenues for future exploration. Finally, the finding that the FAE occurs under masked priming conditions may impact our understanding of masked morphological priming. In this literature, there is a unresolved question about the ability of affixes to elicit masked morphological priming results [for a review, @AmentaCrepaldi2012]. In English, the evidence seems to indicate that only stems, but not affixes, have the ability to prime entries across the lexicon. This finding can and has been used to support models in which affixes are initially stripped before stems are accessed in the lexicon [@TaftForster1975; @ForsterAzuma2000; @StockallMarantz2006]. However, stems and affixes do also have a large frequency imbalance, with most affixes being substantially more frequent that most stems. The observation of FAE under masked priming can provide an alternative reason for why masked stem morphological priming is well attested, but masked affix morphological priming is not: the latter could be due to a ceiling frequency attenuation effect. This is an intriguing possibility that we anticipate to be fruitful to explore in the near future.**
