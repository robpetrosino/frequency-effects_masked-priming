\begin{abstract}
This study addresses the controversy surrounding whether masked
repetition priming is sensitive to word frequency, the Frequency
Attenuation Effect (FAE). Early findings suggested no such interaction,
but recent studies have contradicted this. This uncertainty is
consequential, as word recognition models differ in whether they predict
this effect, and how they account for it in case it does exist. In two
experiments employing very large sample sizes (Ns=2600), we show that
the FAE does occur in masked conditions. In experiment 1, we observed a
FAE of 10ms with a short prime duration (33ms). In experiment 2, we
replicate and extended this finding with a longer prime duration (50ms).
While the magnitude of the repetition priming effects increased with
prime duration, the FAE remained constant. We contend that no word
recognition model can currently account for this pattern of results, but
the entry-opening model may be modified to accommodate these findings.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

Visual word recognition is a complex cognitive function, as written
words engage various visual and linguistic processes and, in the case of
fluent readers, do so in a remarkably fast and accurate manner. Among
many tools that have been developed to study visual word recognition,
one of the most influential is masked priming. Initially developed to
help disentangle automatic and episodic contributions to priming in
lexical decision tasks (Forster and Davis 1984), the masked priming
procedure has since proved valuable to uncover the conditions under
which orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic
information impact access to visual word forms, by mitigating strategic
effects and minimizing the influence of controlled processes (Forster
1998, for review). The masked priming procedure generally involves a
forward mask (i.e., usually a string of hashes, \#\#\#\#\#), followed by
a prime string presented in lowercase for very short time (\(SOA < 60\)
ms), and a target string presented in uppercase immediately after
(\emph{\#\#\#\#\#} - \emph{prime} - \emph{TARGET}) to which participants
are expected to respond. Because the prime presentation is so brief and
masked by preceding and subsequent stimuli, most participants report no
awareness that a prime string has been presented (Forster, Mohan, and
Hector 2003; Nievas 2010).

One of the most robust findings in the masked priming literature is the
\emph{repetition priming effect}: when the prime and target are the same
string (albeit in a different case, e.g., \emph{word-WORD}), the
response to the target is facilitated compared to when the same target
is preceded by an unrelated prime (e.g., \emph{phone-WORD}). The fact
that the size of masked repetition priming effect is proportional to the
duration of the prime (Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003; Angele et al.
2023) has led some researchers to posit that the masked repetition
priming effect reflects a type of ``head start'' in the processing of
the target.

In \emph{Interactive-Activation} (IA) models (McClelland and Rumelhart
1981; Grainger and Jacobs 1996; Coltheart et al. 2001), this ``head
start'' is conceived of as increased activation of the target entry as a
function of its prior activation during the presentation of the prime.
These raised activation levels in turn help the entry reach the
recognition threshold faster.

Alternatively, \emph{search models} like the \emph{entry opening model}
(cf. Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003) posit an \emph{entry opening time}
(EOT) that is uniform across lexical items. In this model, the target's
EOT is entirely or partially saved due to the fact that the entry
opening process is effectively initiated during the presentation of the
prime.

Finally, \emph{retrospective models} of priming, such as the
\emph{memory recruitment model} (Bodner and Masson 1997; Masson and
Bodner 2003; Bodner and Masson 2014), posit a non-lexical source for the
masked repetition priming effect. Under this view, masked repetition
priming stems from the exploitation, at post-access stages, of a memory
resource created by the encounter with the prime word.

\subsection{Does frequency interact with repetition in masked
priming?}\label{does-frequency-interact-with-repetition-in-masked-priming}

The masked repetition effect is a robust finding, but there is still
considerable uncertainty about whether lexical frequency impacts masked
priming. In unmasked contexts, it is well established that
high-frequency words often benefit less from repetition than
low-frequency words (\emph{frequency attenuation effect}, henceforth
FAE; Scarborough, Cortese, and Scarborough 1977). The precise
\emph{locus} of this effect, however, remains the topic of debate. Three
types of models have attempted to explain the FAE in different ways.

\emph{IA} models (McClelland and Rumelhart 1981; Grainger and Jacobs
1996) capture the FAE by positing that once a word is recognized, it
takes time for its activation levels to return to their normal resting
state. If the same word is then encountered again while still highly
activated, it will cross the recognition threshold much faster compared
to when it is at its usual resting activation levels. {In this case, the
facilitation effect gained by repeating the same word is expected to be
additive with word frequency, and should therefore amount to the same
size for both high- and low-frequency words (Figure~\ref{fig-ia-1}, A)
}. Alternatively, these models could propose that each access creates a
small but long-term change in the resting activation levels of the
lexical node, so that prior exposure will always lead to some amount of
priming. In this type of model, the FAE does arise because low frequency
words are hypothesized to have a much lower resting activation level
compared to high frequency words. Thus, any increase activation level
will benefit low frequency words more compared to high frequency words
(Figure~\ref{fig-ia-1}, B).

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,height=0.7\textheight]{./supplemental-data/fig-ia-1.jpg}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ia-1}Additive (panel A) and interactive (panel B)
effects of word frequency and repetition priming as explained in
interactive activation models. In general, the lexical representations
of high-frequency words (e.g., \emph{black}) activate faster than those
of low-frequency words (e.g., \emph{shark}), and is triggered as soon as
the corresponding activation value reaches the recognition threshold.
Priming effects are encoded as the difference between the condition in
which the presentation of the target is preceded by an unrelated word
(unrelated condition, e.g.~\emph{brief-SHARK}) and the condition in
which the target is instead preceded by itself (related condition,
e.g.~\emph{shark-SHARK}). In panel A, priming arises just as a result of
the prior presentation of the related prime, which provides a head start
that is independent of word frequency. In panel B, frequency is assumed
to modulate the resting activation level of the word, thus impinging on
the size of the priming response and ultimately giving rise to FAEs.}

\end{figure}%

\emph{Search models} like the \emph{entry opening model} (Forster and
Davis 1984; Forster 1998), on the other hand, predict that candidate
entries for recognition are evaluated according to their rank order of
frequency (Figure~\ref{fig-eom-1}). Because this is a relatively stable
property of the lexical system, it is unlikely to radically change based
on one or even a few entry accesses. Thus, these models predict that the
FAE must have a different source that is not lexical. In this, they
agree with \emph{retrospective models} (e.g., Jacoby and Dallas 1981;
Jacoby 1983; Bodner and Masson 1997; Masson and Bodner 2003; Bodner and
Masson 2014), according to which it is the activation/retrieval of the
episodic memory trace of the encounter with the prime word that is
responsible for facilitating the behavioral response; the FAE under this
view stems from the independently established fact that low-frequency
words exhibit an advantage in episodic memory tasks (like \emph{old-new}
tasks; Scarborough, Cortese, and Scarborough 1977). Thus, a direct
prediction of this view would be that, if it were possible to minimize
episodic influences, then no FAE should be expected. Forster and Davis
(1984) proposed that masking the priming stimulus could achieve this
effect, adapting the procedure of Evett and Humphreys (1981). Forster
and Davis (1984) established that no FAE arises when the primes are
effectively masked, corroborating their prediction that, being a
post-lexical, episodic memory effect, the FAE should only be observed
when the primes are fully visible and their context is somehow relevant
for the behavioral decision to the target. This finding has since often
been replicated (Forster et al. 1987; Segui and Grainger 1990; Sereno
1991; Forster and Davis 1991; Rajaram and Neely 1992; Bodner and Masson
1997; Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003; Nievas 2010; Norris et al. 2018).

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{\label{fig-eom-1}Graphic representation of the entry opening
model (Forster 1998, 1999). As soon as a word is presented, the parser
goes through a frequency-ordered lexical search and only the entries
that are close and perfect orthographic matches with the stimulus are
opened (entry opening stage). In the figure, the opened entries are
represented as borderless text boxes. Subsequently, each opened entry is
strictly compared to the stimulus (evaluation stage, which is blocked
for prime words in a masked environment). All entries except the actual
match are closed again, thus leading to word recognition.}

\end{figure}%

However, as Table~\ref{tbl-litReview} shows, there are, contrary to the
earlier literature, a number of recent studies that do report
significant FAEs in masked repetition priming (Bodner and Masson 2001;
Kinoshita 2006; Norris and Kinoshita 2008; Nievas 2010; Wu 2012). Bodner
and Masson (2001) argues that when the processing of stimuli is made
harder by an alternating case presentation (e.g., \emph{pHoNe}), the
associated increase in difficulty to perform the lexical decision
generates an extra incentive to draw on the memory resource created by
the brief processing of the prime. Under such conditions, they were able
to observe a statistically significant FAE, as predicted by their
\emph{memory recruitment} model.

Kinoshita (2006) noticed that in earlier studies the low frequency words
often had very high error rates, and suggested that perhaps many
participants did not know them. If participants treated a substantial
number of low frequency words as nonwords, and nonwords do not exhibit
repetition priming under masked conditions, it could artificially
depress the repetition priming effect for the low frequency condition,
which could make any existing FAE harder to detect. In two separate
experiments, Kinoshita (2006) showed that larger repetition priming
effects for low frequency words were only obtained when the low
frequency words were vetted to make sure the participants knew them
prior to the experiment. Following up on Kinoshita (2006), Norris and
Kinoshita (2008) were also able to find an interaction between lexical
frequency and repetition in masked repetition priming, as were Wu (2012)
(exp. 5) and Nievas (2010) in Spanish (exp. 1B).

This uneven pattern of findings is puzzling. However, as
Table~\ref{tbl-litReview} shows (see also Kinoshita 2006), it is
noteworthy that 17 out of the 20 experiments showed numerically larger
masked priming effects for low frequency words as opposed to high
frequency words, irrespective of statistical significance. Similarly,
the average repetition effect for low frequency words in the studies
reviewed in Table~\ref{tbl-litReview} is 15 ms larger when compared to
that of high frequency words.

In summary, it is somewhat surprising that the status of the FAE in
masked priming remains largely unresolved in the literature, given its
non-negligible average magnitude across studies and its theoretical
significance in elucidating the underlying cognitive processes of masked
priming. The experiments reported here were designed put on firmer
empirical footing whether frequency attenuation effects can be observed
under masked priming, as well as whether such an effect is sensitive to
the duration of the prime, which can help distinguish between competing
frameworks of visual word recognition.

\subsection{This study}\label{this-study}

One potential contributor to past discrepancies about the existence of
the FAE in masked priming is the overreliance on the dated Kučera and
Francis (1967)'s word frequency database, which 15 out of the 17 English
experiments have depended on. This frequency database has consistently
demonstrated inferior predictive performance in psycholinguistic
experiments, particularly with low-frequency words, compared to more
contemporary databases (Burgess and Livesay 1998; Zevin and Seidenberg
2002; Balota et al. 2004; Brysbaert and New 2009; Yap and Balota 2009;
Brysbaert and Cortese 2011; Gimenes and New 2016; Herdağdelen and
Marelli 2017; Brysbaert, Mandera, and Keuleers 2018).

Another factor that might have contributed to the conflicting past
findings is the potential underpowered nature of many previous studies,
as already noted by other researchers (Bodner and Masson 1997, 2001;
Masson and Bodner 2003; Adelman et al. 2014). This is a reasonable
concern, as interaction effects like the FAE often require larger sample
sizes for reliable detection compared to main effects (Potvin and Schutz
2000; Brysbaert and Stevens 2018). Our literature review revealed
crucial gaps in the reporting of relevant statistical information, which
impedes the assessment of the statistical power attained by past
experiments. The inconsistent reporting of standard deviations (in only
7 out of 20 experiments) and the complete absence of reporting of the
correlation structure between conditions complicates power assessments.
In our own simulations (full details in supplementary material) the
results reported in Table~\ref{tbl-litReview} reveal a wide range of
possible statistical power attained by previous studies, depending
solely on the combination of plausible standard deviation and
correlation across conditions. As a consequence of the limited reporting
of relevant statistical information in past studies, it is nearly
impossible to determine if any of them were adequately powered to detect
the effect of interest.

Thus, if a non-negligible number of low-powered experiments is in the
scientific record, it may play a role in accounting for the uneven
pattern of results reported thus far. First, if low-powered experiments
are prevalent, it increases the risk of observed statistically
significant effects being spurious (Button et al. 2013). At face value,
only 6 out of 20 experiments report a statistically significant FAE; and
two of these employed a unique alternating-case stimulus presentation
(Bodner and Masson 2001; Masson and Bodner 2003). Among the studies
reporting non-significant FAEs, eleven still exhibit numerically larger
repetition effect sizes for low-frequency compared to high-frequency
words. The observed pattern is difficult to reconcile with the purported
absence of interaction between frequency and masked repetition priming.
The average FAE across all studies stands at 15 ms, a non-negligible
effect size.\footnote{And it is indeed significant, under the naive
  assumption that the two conditions are similar enough across
  experiments:
  \(M_{FAE} = 15 ms, CI_{95\%} = [8 ~ 21];~t(19) = 4.89, p=.0001\).}
These considerations suggest that a genuine FAE may indeed exist in
masked priming, but might be smaller than the magnitudes that are
statistically detectable in most previous experiments. This
interpretation is supported by the results from Adelman et al. (2014) in
a large scale, multi-site lab-based study on orthographic priming. They
report a small but reliable FAE, but caution this effect could simply be
an orthographic neighborhood effect masquerading as a frequency effect,
due to the high correlations between the two variables. The lack of
clarity surrounding the statistical power of previous studies makes it
difficult to discern whether past statistically significant findings may
be spurious.

Second, it is widely acknowledged that experiments with approximately
50\% power are akin to a coin toss in their ability to detect a true
effect (Cohen 1992). A less-appreciated fact is that, in the presence of
even lower power (\(<25%
\)), statistically significant results can substantially overestimate
the effect size -- a type-M error (Gelman and Carlin 2014). When power
drops to levels below 10\%, a statistically significant result may occur
even when the observed effect goes in the opposite direction of the true
effect -- a type-S error (Gelman and Carlin 2014). Our power simulations
for within-subjects data revealed a similar relationship between
statistical power, type-M, and type-S errors in line with the
observations detailed by Gelman and Carlin (2014) for the independent
samples case. For instance, at 10\% power (a possibility for virtually
all previous studies, as indicated in Table~\ref{tbl-litReview}), a
statistically significant result could indicate an overestimation of the
magnitude of the frequency attenuation effect by a factor between 2 and
5, with up to a 5\% chance of incorrectly determining the direction of
the effect.

The study reported here was designed to mitigate these two major
confounding issues: overreliance on the Kučera and Francis (1967)
frequency counts, as well as the potential lack of statistical power in
previous research. With respect to the concern about the unreliable
nature of the Kučera and Francis (1967) corpus, we exclusively sourced
materials from the SUBTLEX\(_{US}\) database (Brysbaert and New 2009),
which reflects more recent linguistic usage and offer better validation
in behavioral experiments (e.g., Brysbaert and New 2009; Yap and Balota
2009; Brysbaert and Cortese 2011; Gimenes and New 2016; Herdağdelen and
Marelli 2017). In order to avoid any issues with statistical power, we
recruited two extremely large samples (\(Ns=2600\)) to achieve high
statistical power for an interaction effect like the FAE (see
supplementary materials) and narrow margins of error around the
estimated effect size (Maxwell, Kelley, and Rausch 2008).

\subsection{Web browser-based masked
priming}\label{web-browser-based-masked-priming}

Achieving the desired level of statistical power required a sample size
that would be impractical to pursue in traditional lab settings,
typically constrained by access to limited research computers and
participant pools. In response to this challenge, the present studies
were exclusively conducted online, leveraging the growing trend in
online behavioral research facilitated by HTML5 capabilities and the
availability of advanced web software such as \emph{jsPsych} (de Leeuw
2014), \emph{PsychoJS} (the JavaScript counterpart of \emph{PsychoPy},
Peirce et al. 2019), \emph{Gorilla} (Anwyl-Irvine et al. 2020), and
\emph{Labvanced} (Finger et al. 2017).

experiments conducted online, together with unpublished pilot data from
our lab, investigating three different phenomena: identity,
morphological and semantic priming, at 33ms and 50ms prime durations.}

\end{figure}%

Notably, three recent studies have already demonstrated the viability of
conducting masked priming experiments online, employing different
software tools: Angele et al. (2023) with \emph{PsychoJS}, Cayado, Wray,
and Stockall (2023) with \emph{Gorilla} and Petrosino, Sprouse, and
Almeida (2023) with \emph{Labvanced}. Crucially, a meta-analysis (Bonett
2009) of their results (Figure~\ref{fig-meta}; full details in the
supplemental material) show a clear replication of four basic benchmark
results in masked priming: detection of (i) repetition and (ii)
morphological priming with (iii) no evidence of semantic priming, as
well as (iv) a proportionality effect of repetition priming and prime
duration.

Building on these previous findings, experiment 1 attempts to determine
whether frequency attenuation effects can be observed under masked
priming. Experiment 2 focuses on whether frequency attenuation effects
may vary as a function of prime duration.

\section{Experiment 1}\label{sec-exp1}

Experiment 1 was designed to elicit a masked repetition priming response
to both high- and low-frequency words. The required sample size to
ensure adequate statistical power (\textgreater80\%) was determined
through a power analysis simulation (details and code available as
supplemental material at \url{https://osf.io/r7d2q/}). For a 10 ms FAE,
a sample size of 1,250 participants was identified as necessary to
maintain 80\% statistical power across a wide range of plausible
standard deviations and correlation structures between conditions. Given
the relatively untested nature of web browser-based masked priming
experiments, we opted for a larger sample size of 2,600 participants.
This decision was made to increase the likelihood of retaining at least
1,250 participants after applying exclusion criteria, while also
guaranteeing a narrow margin of error around the estimated effect size
(Maxwell, Kelley, and Rausch 2008).

The prime duration was set at 33 ms for three main reasons. First, prior
studies by Angele et al. (2023), Cayado, Wray, and Stockall (2023), and
Petrosino, Sprouse, and Almeida (2023) have demonstrated that a 33 ms
prime duration is sufficient to elicit reliable repetition priming
effects in web browser-based experiments. Second, this brief prime
duration ensures that the prime word is almost never consciously
perceived by participants (Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003; Nievas
2010), providing a more accurate measure of early, presumably automatic
processes involved in word recognition. Lastly, previous research on the
\emph{Labvanced} platform (Petrosino, Sprouse, and Almeida 2023) has
shown that timing inaccuracies and missed screen refreshes can lead to
an increased number of trials with actual prime durations exceeding the
subliminal threshold (typically considered to be around 60 ms) when the
prime duration is set to 50 ms. If a significant number of trials exceed
the subliminal threshold, it may prompt participants to adopt
experiment-wide strategies, ultimately compromising the observed masked
priming response (Zimmerman and Gomez 2012).

\subsection{Methods}\label{sec-exp1-methods}

\subsubsection{Preregistration}\label{sec-exp1-prereg}

We preregistered the results of the power analysis, the goals, the
design and analysis plan for this experiment prior to data collection.
The preregistration is available online
(\url{https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3NFQP}).

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{sec-exp1-methods-participants}

Two thousand and six hundred participants (1,445 females; \emph{mean
age} = 42, \emph{sd age} = 14) were recruited on Prolific
(\url{https://www.prolific.com}). Several criteria were selected to
ensure recruitment of native speakers of U.S. English: participants had
to be born in the Unites States of America, speak English as their first
and only language, and have no self-reported language-related disorder.
We encouraged participants to avoid any sort of distraction throughout
the experiment, and to close any program that may be running in the
background. However, because the experiment was run online, participants
could not be monitored during data collection. Finally, to further
reduce variability across participants' devices, we restricted the
experiment to be run on Google Chrome only, which at the time of this
writing is the most used browser worldwide (W3 Counter 2023), and
reportedly performs better than any other across operating systems (see
Lukács and Gartus 2023).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{sec-exp1-methods-design}

The masked priming procedure relied on a lexical decision task (LDT), in
which a 3 (factor: \emph{high} vs \emph{low} vs \emph{nonword}) x 2
(primetype: \emph{repetition} vs \emph{unrelated}) factorial
within-subject design was used. The dependent variables were lexical
decision latency (RT, in milliseconds) and error rate (in percentages).

\subsubsection{Materials}\label{sec-exp1-methods-materials}

One-hundred and four five-letter words, half of low frequency (between 7
and 24 occurrences per million in the SUBTLEX\(_{US}\) corpus) and half
of high frequency (between 57 and 2,961 occurrences per million in the
SUBTLEX\(_{US}\)) were sampled from the English Lexicon Project (Balota
et al. 2007). From each condition, 26 words were selected to be
presented as targets and related primes (the \emph{repetition}
condition), and the remaining 26 were presented as unrelated primes (the
\emph{unrelated} condition). All word items were also controlled for
orthographic neighborhood (i.e., Coltheart's \emph{N}): \(t \approx 0\).
All words used were monomorphemic nouns, adjectives, or verbs, thus
excluding particles, prepositions, and derived or inflected forms, with
a reported accuracy above 90\%. The descriptive statistics of the words
used is reported in Table~\ref{tbl-words}.

\end{table}%

One-hundred and four five-letter, phono-orthographically legal non-words
were randomly selected from the English Lexicon Project database as
well. Half of them (i.e., 52) were randomly selected to be presented as
targets; the other half was instead used as unrelated non-word primes.
None of the non-words contained any existing English morpheme. In
addition, all items had an error rate in the ELP smaller than 10\%, to
ensure that they would all be clearly distinguishable from words by
participants. All items used in the experiments are reported in the
appendix at the end of the paper (after the References section).

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{sec-exp1-methods-proc}

Each recruited participant was assigned one of two word lists, which
differed only in the relatedness of the prime with respect to the
target; otherwise, the two lists presented the same set of target words
and nonwords (i.e., 104 pairs for each list). In one list, the three
conditions (the high- and low-frequency word conditions, and the
non-word condition) had half of the target items being preceded by
themselves (the \emph{repetition} condition) and half of the target
items being preceded by one of the unrelated primes belonging to the
same frequency bin (the \emph{unrelated} condition). In the other list,
these assignments were reversed. The order of stimulus presentation was
randomized for each participant.

After being recruited in the \emph{Prolific} online platform,
participants were asked to click on a link redirecting them to the
\emph{Labvanced} online service. During the experiment, they were asked
to perform a lexical decision task by pressing either the `J' (for word)
or `F' (for non-word) keys on their keyboard. Each trial consisted of
three different stimuli appearing at the center of the screen: a series
of five hashes (\#\#\#\#\#) presented for 500 ms, followed by a prime
word presented for 33 ms, and finally the target word; the target word
disappeared from the screen as soon as a decision was made.

Participants were given 5 breaks throughout the experiment. When the
experiment was over, the participants were then redirected to Prolific
in order to validate their submission. The median time to finish the
experiment was 6 minutes and participants were paid a rate of 9
GBP/hour.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{sec-exp1-analysis}

Priming effects were calculated by subtracting the mean RT to the
related condition to the mean RT from the unrelated condition. We ran
two different analyses, for both RT and error data. Our preregistered
data analysis plan established that the data would be analyzed using a
2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA (factor, 2 levels: \emph{high}
vs.~\emph{low}; primetype, 2 levels: \emph{unrelated}
vs.~\emph{repetition}), with only subjects as random factors, followed
by planned comparisons between related and unrelated primetype for the
word conditions, as well as the non-word condition. The choice of this
statistical model follows the recommendations of Raaijmakers,
Schrijnemakers, and Gremmen (1999) and Raaijmakers (2003), and allowed
us to carry out the prior power analysis simulations that informed our
sample size choice, since models that include items as random factors or
even as crossed random factors are too computationally expensive to run
in large scale statistical power simulations. However, we also present
an 2x2 analysis using Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) analysis on
the raw RT and the raw accuracy data, since these models have become
more widely adopted. Unlike linear mixed-effect models, GLMMs do not
assume normal distribution of the data, and are therefore particularly
useful for non-normally distributed data such as RTs and accuracy. For
the RT data, a Gamma distribution was used; for the accuracy data, a
binomial distribution was used instead. Both models used an identity
link between fixed effects and the dependent variable (Lo and Andrews
2015). To prevent converge failure, the model was kept as simple as
possible, with \emph{factor} (2 levels: high vs.~low), \emph{primetype}
(2 levels: unrelated vs related) and their interaction as fixed effects.
Subjects and items were crossed as random effects. Before fitting the
model, the contrasts were also set to sum-to-zero contrasts (i.e., by
using the R function \texttt{contr.sum()}) to facilitate interpretation
of main and interaction effects. The fitting was performed by using the
\texttt{lme4} R-package (Bates et al. 2015) with the Laplace
approximation technique, using 1 million iterations and the BOBYQA
optimizer to help convergence. The function \texttt{Anova()} from the
\texttt{car} R-package (Fox and Weisberg 2019) was used to obtain
estimates and probability values for fixed effects calculated for
Type-III sums of squares. The function \texttt{emmeans()} from the
\texttt{emmeans} R-package (Lenth 2024) was used to calculate the
estimated marginal means based on a separate 3x2 GLMM model, similarly
defined as above, but including the non-word condition.

Analysis scripts and an abridged version of the data collected can be
found online (\url{https://osf.io/vn3r2}), and consisted of 297,598
observations in total. The pre-processing of the data consisted of three
separate steps.

\subsubsection{Step 1: subject and item
performance}\label{sec-exp1-analysis-performance}

Item and subject error rates were calculated. The item error rate was
never above 14\%, so no item was excluded from analysis. Nineteen
subjects were removed because their error rate was above 30\%. A total
of 269,652 observations and 2,593 participants were kept for analysis
for this first step.

\subsubsection{Step 2: prime
durations}\label{sec-exp1-analysis-primeTime}

During the experiment, the duration of presentation of the prime word
was recorded for every trial. On average, the prime duration was kept to
its requested value (mean = 32 ms). However, the standard deviation of
15 ms indicated some imprecision in the presentation of the prime. We
only kept trials whose prime durations were within a pre-set range from
the intended prime duration of 33 ms. Taking a standard 60-Hz monitor as
reference, the lower and the upper bounds were set respectively at 25 ms
(i.e., the intended prime duration minus half of a full refresh cycle:
\(33-8~ ms\); noting that Angele et al. (2023) already showed that no
repetition priming effects are obtained with a 16.7ms prime duration)
and 60 ms (i.e., the commonly accepted upper threshold of subliminal
processing), in an attempt to remove any trial that could have been
consciously perceived by participants. This cut-off removed 13\% of the
trials. No participant was excluded, for a total of 237,287 remaining
observations.

\subsubsection{Step 3: RT analysis}\label{sec-exp1-analysis-RT}

After removing the incorrect responses, 0.51\% of the trials were
excluded because their corresponding RT was below 200 ms or above 1800
ms. Finally, 249 subjects were removed because the number of trials
within the same condition was less than 7 (about half of the total
number of trials being presented within the same condition, i.e.~13). A
total of 210,889 observations and 2,341 subjects remained avaialble for
statistical analysis.

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-exp1-results}

The preregistered 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant main
effects (factor: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=1572, \emph{p}\textless.0001;
primetype: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=1113, \emph{p}\textless.0001) and their
interaction (\emph{F}(1, 2340)=52.48, \emph{p}\textless.0001). Planned
comparisons confirmed statistically significant repetition priming
effects for both word conditions (\(MOP_{HF}\)=18 ms,
\(CI_{95\%}\)={[}16 20{]}, \emph{t}(2340)=19.7, \emph{p}\textless.0001;
\(MOP_{LF}\) = 28 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}26 30{]}, \emph{t}(2340)=27.8,
\emph{p}\textless.0001), with the low-frequency word repetition priming
effect being 10 ms larger than the high-frequency word repetition
priming effect. This FAE effect was statistically significant
(\(M_{FAE}\)=10 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}7 13{]}, \emph{t}(2340)=7.24,
\emph{p}\textless.0001). A very small, but statistically significant
inhibitory priming effect was observed in the non-word condition
(\(MOP_{NW}\)=-2 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}-4 0{]}, \emph{t}(2340)=-2.33,
\emph{p}\textless.0001). Similarly, the 2x2 GLMM analysis confirmed that
both main effects (factor: \(\chi^2(1)=12.89, p=.0003\); primetype:
\(\chi^2(1)=421.39, p<.0001\)), and their interaction
(\(\chi^2(1)=4.97, p=.03\)) were significant. As reported in
Table~\ref{tbl-exp1-statsResults-anova} and
Table~\ref{tbl-exp1-statsResults-glmm}, the priming effects sizes based
on the ANOVA and GLMM models are all comparable with one another.

In the error analysis, the 2x2 ANOVA revealed significant effects for
both main effects (factor: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=392.5,
\emph{p}\textless.0001; primetype: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=380.5,
\emph{p}\textless.0001) and interaction (\emph{F}(1, 2340)=55.47,
\emph{p}\textless.0001). Planned comparisons revealed significant
priming effects in the form of fewer errors in the repeated compared to
unrelated trials in the word condition (high:
\(M = 1.34, CI_{95\%}=[1.07 ~ 1.6], t(2340)=9.95, p<.0001\); low:
\(M = 2.98, CI_{95\%} = [2.64 ~ 3.33], t(2340)=16.9, p<.0001\)), and an
inverse effect in the non-word condition
(\(M = -0.42, CI_{95\%} = [-0.67 ~ -0.17]\), \emph{t}(2340)=-3.27,
\emph{p}=.001). Similarly, the 2x2 GLMM analysis revealed significance
for both the main effects (factor: \(\chi^2(1)=30.45, p<.0001\);
primetype: \(\chi^2(1)=108.88, p<.0001\)) and their interaction
(\(\chi^2(1)=307.57, p<.0001\)). The GLMM estimated marginal means from
the corresponding 3x2 GLMM model indicated the same trends as the ANOVA
planned comparisons: a facilitatory effect in both word conditions
(high: \(\beta = 0.58, SE = 0.056, z=10.434, p<.0001\); low:
\(\beta = 0.74, SE = 0.042, z=17.62, p<.0001\)), and an inhibitory
effect in the non-word condition
(\(\beta = -0.11, SE = 0.031, z=-3.50, p=.0005\)).

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec-exp1-discussion}

Experiment 1 was designed to investigate whether Frequency Attenuation
Effects (FAE) can be detected in masked priming with a prime duration of
33 ms. Our findings replicated the results of Angele et al. (2023),
Cayado, Wray, and Stockall (2023), and Petrosino, Sprouse, and Almeida
(2023), showing statistically significant masked repetition priming
effects in a web browser-based experiment for both high- and
low-frequency words. Crucially, the results also confirmed the presence
of an FAE, evidenced by a statistically significant interaction: the
priming effect for low-frequency words was 10 ms larger than that for
high-frequency words. Additionally, due to the large sample size, the
FAE was estimated with high precision, yielding a narrow margin of error
of 3 ms. Interestingly, in addition to the reliable FAE, our results
align with previous studies (Cayado, Wray, and Stockall 2023; Petrosino,
Sprouse, and Almeida 2023) in showing a minimal inhibitory masked
repetition priming effect for non-words, with very high precision. The
95\% confidence interval (CI) suggests that the plausible range for the
masked repetition priming effect for non-words, at a prime duration of
33 ms, is between -4 ms and 0 ms.

These findings help dispel doubts about whether an FAE can be observed
in masked priming, challenging earlier studies that failed to detect
this effect. However, the results also raise questions about the size
and malleability of the effect. The FAE observed in Experiment 1 (10 ms)
is substantially smaller than those reported in other studies where
significant FAEs were found (e.g., Kinoshita 2006), where the effect was
around 30 ms. What could account for this discrepancy in effect size?
One possibility is that the 30 ms estimate is inflated due to the lower
statistical power in many previous experiments. As noted in the
introduction, low power can lead to overestimated effect sizes when
results are statistically significant. When examining the range of
effect sizes in Table~\ref{tbl-litReview}, we find that the average FAE
is approximately 15 ms, which is half the size of those observed when
statistically significant results were obtained. This 15 ms estimate is
closer to the 10 ms effect size observed in Experiment 1, but still
somewhat larger. Thus, there appears to be a potential discrepancy
between the FAE effect sizes reported in the literature and the estimate
from Experiment 1.

One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in prime
duration used in Experiment 1 (33 ms) compared to most previous studies
(i.e., between 40 and 60 ms). It is plausible that the FAE scales
linearly with prime duration in masked priming, similar to how
repetition priming effects increase with longer prime durations. In
fact, this is an actual prediction of \emph{IA} models (see Grainger et
al. 2012). Fortunately, Angele et al. (2023) and Petrosino, Sprouse, and
Almeida (2023) have already demonstrated that web browser-based
experiments can replicate the proportionality between prime duration and
the magnitude of masked identity priming, consistent with Forster,
Mohan, and Hector (2003). Both studies showed that increasing the prime
duration from 33 ms to 50 ms resulted in larger identity priming
effects. This provides an opportunity to test whether the discrepancy in
FAE effect size between Experiment 1 and prior literature is due to the
shorter prime duration used in our study. The goal of Experiment 2,
therefore, is to leverage the established linear scaling of repetition
effects with prime duration in masked priming to determine whether
extending the prime duration also increases the magnitude of the FAE.

\section{Experiment 2}\label{sec-exp2}

Experiment 2 is an exact replication of experiment 1, with one
difference: the prime duration is set to 50ms instead of 33ms. The
predictions are straightforward: if the FAE scales with prime duration,
then the FAE in experiment 2 should be larger than the one observed in
experiment 1. This result would explain why the FAE observed in
experiment 1 was smaller than the ones observed in prior studies.

In order to facilitate the interpretation of the results of experiment
2, we calculate the 95\% \emph{prediction intervals} (PI; cf. Patil,
Peng, and Leek 2016; Spence and Stanley 2016) for a replication of
experiment 1 with the effective sample size of experiment 2 (cf.
Section~\ref{sec-exp2-analysis-RT}). The logic of the \emph{prediction
interval} is to establish a range of possible effect sizes that can be
expected in a replication due only to sampling error. In order words, if
the only difference between the original study and the replication study
is sampling variability, we should expect the effect sizes of the
replication study to fall within the 95\% PI set by the original study.

According to Table~\ref{tbl-pis}, we can make the following predictions
for experiment 2: (1) Non-word repetition effects in masked priming are
thought to be independent of prime duration (mostly because they are at
best negligible to begin with). Thus, as far as the non-words are
concerned, experiment 2 can be seen as a simple replication of
experiment 1. The \(PI_{95\%}\) for non-words from experiment 1 is
{[}-5ms 1ms{]}. Thus, we expect that the effect size for non-word
repetition in experiment 2 could be as low a -5ms or as high as 1ms; any
result beyond these bounds would strongly imply that the differences
between the effect sizes of the two experiments cannot be explained
simply in terms of sampling error. (2) Masked repetition effects for
words, on the other hand, are thought to linearly increase in magnitude
as a function of prime duration. Thus, we expect that in experiment 2
the repetition effect size for the LF and HF conditions should be
superior to the upper bounds of the \(PI_{95\%}\) of experiment 1. The
\(PI_{95\%}\) from experiment 1 for the the repetition of HF words is
{[}15 21{]} ms; the one for the LF condition is {[}25 31{]} ms. Thus, if
our prime duration manipulation is successful in experiment 2, we should
expect the repetition effect for the HF condition to be larger than 21ms
while the same effect for the LF condition should be larger than 31 ms.
(3) It is presently unclear whether the FAE interacts with prime
duration. Given the FAE \(PI_{95\%}\) {[}6 14{]} ms from experiment 1,
we can interpret the results of experiment 2 in the following manner: if
the FAE in experiment 2 falls within the {[}6 14{]} ms interval, we have
no particular reason to think that FAE interacts with prime duration, as
this result is exactly what would have been predicted if experiment 2
was a direct replication of experiment 1. However, if the FAE in
experiment 2 is larger than 14 ms (as the previous literature implies),
then we have good reason to believe that the FAE linearly scales with
prime duration, much like masked repetition priming effects do.

\subsection{Methods}\label{sec-exp2-methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{sec-exp2-methods-participants}

Two thousand and six hundred participants (1,551 females; \emph{mean
age} = 39, \emph{sd age} = 12) were recruited on Prolific
(\url{https://www.prolific.com}) with the same criteria specified for
experiment 1 (Section~\ref{sec-exp1-methods-participants}). Participants
from experiment 1 were not allowed to enroll in this experiment.

\subsubsection{Design}\label{sec-exp2-methods-design}

The experimental design was identical to experiment 1.

\subsubsection{Materials}\label{sec-exp2-methods-materials}

The experimental items were the same as experiment 1.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{sec-exp2-methods-proc}

Experiment 2 followed the same procedures as experiment 1 (see
Section~\ref{sec-exp1-methods-proc}). The only difference was the prime
duration, which was set to 50 ms. The median time to finish the
experiment was about 6 minutes, like in experiment 1.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{sec-exp2-analysis}

The analysis and data pre-processing plan were the same as in experiment
1 (Section~\ref{sec-exp1-analysis}). Analysis scripts and an abridged
version of the data collected can be found online
(\url{https://osf.io/k3gpc}), and consisted of 295,940 observations in
total.

\subsubsection{Step 1: subject and item
performance}\label{sec-exp2-analysis-performance}

No item had an error rate superior to 12\%, so no item was excluded from
analysis. Thirty-nine subjects were removed because their error rate was
above 30\%. Thus, a total of 265,982 observations and 2,558 participants
remained available for further analyses.

\subsubsection{Step 2: prime
durations}\label{sec-exp2-analysis-primeTime}

Prime fluctuations were dealt with in the same way as in experiment 1
(Section~\ref{sec-exp1-analysis-primeTime}). The mean (50.11 ms, SD =
11.13 ms) and the median (50 ms) prime durations were close to the
intended value (50 ms). Any trial whose prime duration was out of the
25-60ms range was excluded, resulting in the removal of 20\% of the
trials. As compared to experiment 1, experiment 2 had a 7\% larger
percentage of removed out-of-range trials, the majority of which (18\%)
were above the likely subliminal threshold of 60 ms. This is in contrast
with the distribution of the prime durations in experiment 1, where the
trials above the range amounted to 0.31\% of the dataset. As observed in
previous studies and pilots conducted in our lab, this distribution
suggests that setting the prime duration closer to either limit of a
given range has the side effect of allowing for more fluctuations beyond
either limit, thus potentially leading to greater data loss. No
participant was excluded, and a total of 213,078 observations remained
available for analysis.

\subsubsection{Step 3: RT analysis}\label{sec-exp2-analysis-RT}

After removing the incorrect responses, 0.59\% of the trials were
excluded because their corresponding RT was below 200 ms or above 1800
ms. Finally, 634 subjects were removed because the number of trials
within the same condition was less than 7. A total of 168,195
observations and 1,924 subjects remained available for statistical
analysis.

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-exp2-results}

In the word analysis, the 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA model revealed
significant main effects (factor: \emph{F}(1, 1923)=987.4,
\emph{p}\textless.0001; primetype: \emph{F}(1, 1923)=1447,
\emph{p}\textless.0001) and interaction (\emph{F}(1, 1923)=36.82,
\emph{p}\textless.0001). Planned comparisons confirmed statistically
significant repetition priming effects for both word conditions
(\(MOP_{HF}\)=26 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}24 28{]}, \emph{t}(1923)=24.6,
\emph{p}\textless.0001; \(MOP_{LF}\) = 35 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}33 37{]},
\emph{t}(1923)=30.2, \emph{p}\textless.0001), with the low-frequency
word repetition priming effect being 10 ms larger than the
high-frequency word repetition priming effect. This FAE effect was
statistically significant (\(M_{FAE}\)=9 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}6 12{]}),
\emph{t}(1920)=6.07, \emph{p}\textless.0001). A very small but
statistically significant inhibitory priming effect was observed in the
non-word condition (\(MOP_{NW}\)=-4 ms, \(CI_{95\%}\)={[}-6 -2{]},
\emph{t}(1923)=-3.53, \emph{p}=.0004). The 2x2 GLMM analysis confirmed
significant effects for condition (\(\chi^2(1)=834.43, p<.0001\)),
primetype (\(\chi^2(1)=3274.43, p<.0001\)), and their interaction
(\(\chi^2(1)=219.76, p<.0001\)). Similarly to experiment 1, the
estimates of both models were comparable to one another (see
Table~\ref{tbl-exp2-statsResults-anova} and
Table~\ref{tbl-exp2-statsResults-glmm})

In the error analysis, the 2x2 ANOVA showed significant effects for both
main effects (factor: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=392.5, \emph{p}\textless.0001;
primetype: \emph{F}(1, 2340)=380.5, \emph{p}\textless.0001) and
interaction (\emph{F}(1, 2340)=55.47, \emph{p}\textless.0001). Planned
comparisons confirmed significant priming effects in the form of fewer
errors in repeated compared to unrelated trials in the word conditions
(high: \(M = 1.29, CI_{95\%}=[1.02 ~ 1.56], t(1923)=9.30, p<.0001\);
low: \(M = 3.05, CI_{95\%}=[2.67 ~ 3.43], t(1923)=15.8, p<.0001\)), and
an inverse effect in the non-word condition
(\(M = -0.35, CI_{}=[-0.64 ~ -0.054], t(1923)=-2.32, p=.002\)). Similar
results were obtained in the 2x2 GLMM error analysis (condition:
\(\chi^2(1)=4.95, p=.02\); primetype: \(\chi^2(1)=101.53, p<.0001\);
interaction: \(\chi^2(1)=7.18, p=.007\)). The GLMM estimated marginal
means from the corresponding 3x2 GLMM model indicated the same trends as
the ANOVA planned comparisons: (high:
\(\beta = 0.64, SE = 0.065, z=9.87, p<.0001\); low:
\(\beta = 0.87, SE = 0.051, z=17.14, p<.0001\)), and an inhibitory
effect in the non-word condition
(\(\beta = -0.08, SE = 0.033, z=-2.96, p=.02\)).

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec-exp2-discussion}

Experiment 2 aimed to replicate the FAE observed in Experiment 1 using
an extended prime duration of 50 ms, and to assess whether this longer
prime would amplify the effect. To achieve this, the same stimuli and
sample size from Experiment 1 were employed, with the sole modification
being the increased prime duration.

As predicted, as compared to experiment 1, we found an increase in the
masked repetition priming effects for both word conditions in experiment
2, by approximately 8 ms for high-frequency
(\(M_{exp1} = 18ms ~ [16 ~ 20], M_{exp2} = 26ms ~ [24 ~ 28]\)) and 7 ms
for low-frequency
(\(M_{exp1} = 28ms ~ [26 ~ 30], M_{exp2} = 35ms ~ [33 ~ 37]\)) words.
Specifically, the repetition priming effect for high-frequency words was
26 ms, and for low-frequency words, 35 ms, both exceeding the upper
bounds of the 95\% prediction interval from Experiment 1 (20 ms and 30
ms, respectively; see Table~\ref{tbl-pis}). This indicates that the
manipulation of prime duration was effective. Notably, and consistent
with our predictions, the repetition effect for the non-word condition
was -2 ms, which fell within the 95\% prediction interval of Experiment
1 (i.e., {[}-5 1{]}). Furthermore, the larger priming response for the
high- and low-frequency word conditions in Experiment 2 was driven
entirely by faster recognition of the related word pairs. The RT
estimates for the unrelated pairs, along with their standard deviations
and error rates, were virtually identically to those observed in
Experiment 1, despite being from a completely different set of
participants. This finding further corroborates the long-standing
observation that the magnitude of the masked priming response is
influenced by prime duration (Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003).

Crucially, we were also able to replicate the FAE in Experiment 2.
However, the FAE in this experiment was 9 ms (\(CI_{95\%} = [6 ~ 12]\)),
which is nearly identical to the FAE observed in Experiment 1 and falls
within its 95\% prediction interval, i.e.~{[}6 14{]} ms. This suggests
that, unlike the repetition effect in masked priming, the FAE does not
interact with prime duration. Therefore, the difference in prime
duration between Experiment 1 and prior studies in the literature does
not appear to account for the observed discrepancies in the magnitude of
the FAEs.

\section{General discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

Establishing whether the FAE is observable in masked repetition priming
is theoretically important, as different word recognition models make
divergent predictions about whether the FAE should occur in masked
priming, and, if it does, how it should be explained.

\subsection{Accounting for the FAE}\label{accounting-for-the-fae}

On one side, \emph{interactive activation} (IA) models (McClelland and
Rumelhart 1981; Grainger and Jacobs 1996; Coltheart et al. 2001) and
\emph{retrospective models} of priming, such as the \emph{memory
recruitment model} (Bodner and Masson 1997; Masson and Bodner 2003;
Bodner and Masson 2014), predict the FAE in masked priming. However,
these theories differ in where they locate the effect. \emph{IA} models
predict a lexical origin (see Grainger et al. 2012), while the memory
recruitment model suggests a post-lexical source.

On the other side, \emph{search models}, such as the \emph{entry-opening
model} (Forster and Davis 1984), propose a more complex interaction
between lexical and episodic memory. Specially, this model posit that
under unmasked conditions, repetition priming is driven largely by
\emph{episodic} memory, but under masked priming, \emph{episodic} memory
plays no role, and thus masked repetition priming reveals primarily
\emph{lexical} (and perhaps also \emph{sublexical}) level processes.
According to the \emph{entry-opening model}, only two processes are at
play within lexical structure: a frequency-ordered search and the time
required to open an entry once a potential match is flagged (the
\emph{entry opening time}, EOT). The search is sensitive to word
frequency, but the EOT is assumed to be uniform across all entries (and
it is estimated at roughly 60 ms by Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003).
Consequently, the model predicts no interaction between frequency and
repetition priming under masked conditions, meaning the FAE should not
be observable in masked repetition priming.

Clearly then, the FAE in experiments 1 and 2 empirically aligns with the
predictions of \emph{IA} and \emph{memory recruitment} models, insofar
as both models predict an FAE under masked conditions. These findings
contradict the \emph{entry opening model}, which predict no FAE in
masked repetition priming.

However, further considerations suggest that the FAEs observed in our
studies may be less supportive of the \emph{memory recruitment model},
which predicts the FAE only when the context of the behavioral task
justifies drawing on non-lexical memory resources post-lexically, such
as when task difficulty is increased. In our experiments, task
difficulty was deliberately minimized: both words and non-words had very
high accuracy rates in the English Lexicon Project (\textgreater90\%,
see Table~\ref{tbl-words}), leading to item error rates that were never
higher than 14\%, entirely avoiding the need for item exclusions. In
addition, only 58 in 5200 participants (1.1\% of the total sample) had
an overall error rate above 30\%. Finally, many researchers may find
implausible the assumption that episodic memory resources are formed at
the very short prime duration used in experiment 1 (33 ms).

Conversely, the \emph{entry-opening model} predicts a null FAE because
it assumes a fixed EOT. This assumption, based on the observation that
the magnitude of masked repetition effects mirror prime duration up to
60 ms (Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003), is contradicted by our
findings. In Experiment 2, where the prime duration was 50 ms, the
maximum repetition priming effect was 35 ms, suggesting that EOTs are
not fixed at 60 ms, nor do they match the prime duration in general (see
Wu 2012 for a similar argument). Moreover, repetition priming effects
were consistently smaller for high-frequency words, further challenging
the model's assumption of uniform EOTs. Thus, if we relax the assumption
that EOTs are uniform across the lexicon and instead posit that
lower-frequency words have longer entry opening times than
higher-frequency words, the \emph{entry-opening model}, like \emph{IA}
models, could account for the FAE.

\subsection{The independence of FAE from prime
duration}\label{the-independence-of-fae-from-prime-duration}

What about the finding that the FAE does not seem to interact with prime
duration? Here, all models seem to make the wrong predictions. \emph{IA}
models assume that it is stimulus exposure that drives activation of
lexical nodes, and that frequency is directly related with lexical nodes
activation levels, either in terms of setting their resting levels or in
how fast they accumulate information from the input. Grainger et al.
(2012) explains how the FAE is predicted by such a model: low-frequency
words accumulate evidence more slowly that do high-frequency words. If
one posits that stimulus repetition provide a uniform boost to lexical
nodes, then compared to a situation where lexical nodes are at their
resting activation levels (the unrelated condition), lower-frequency
repeated words will reach their recognition threshold comparatively
faster than would repeated high-frequency words (cf. Grainger et al.
2012, fig. 1). Under this view, however, the amount of activation boost
to lexical nodes in the related condition is a function of stimulus
exposure, and thus a longer prime duration should deliver a stronger
initial activation boost, which can only lead to a magnification of the
FAE (\textbf{?@fig-ia-2}). Therefore, it seems that the basic mechanics
of \emph{IA} models, together with the assumptions that allow them to
capture the FAE, also predict an interactive effect between FAE
magnitude and prime duration, with larger FAE magnitudes predicted when
prime durations are longer. In experiments 1 and 2, however, the
increase from a 33ms to a 50ms prime duration elicited FAEs of same
magnitude (approximately 10ms).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{./supplemental-data/fig-ia-2.jpg}}\{\#fig-ia-2
fig-pos=``H''å\}

The original \emph{entry opening model} does not predict a FAE, and so
it cannot make any predictions about its potential interaction with
prime duration. \textbf{(I think a logic step is missing here:) This is
because the original model assumes the size of identity priming to
amount to the EOT or prime duration (whichever is smaller), but should
not be modulated by prime duration (Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003; Wu
2012). On the other hand, the modified version of the \emph{entry
opening model} sketched above would be able to. While still assuming
that identity priming be equal to EOT or prime duration (whichever is
smaller), the model we can be modified by arguing that the EOT is a
function of word frequency. In this sense,} if the EOT is larger for
lower-frequency words, then the relationship between prime duration and
FAE is predicted to be somewhat non-linear (see Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}).
While prime duration equals the EOTs of the higher frequency words, and
is therefore smaller than the EOTs of the lower frequency words, no FAE
should be observed, \textbf{since the priming magnitude of both high-
and low-frequency words should equally amount to the prime duration
(Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}, scenario A)}. While the prime duration exceeds
the EOTs for the higher frequency words, but it is still shorter than
the EOTs of the lower frequency words, the FAE should increase linearly
with prime duration (Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}, scenario B), and should
reach its maximum when the prime duration equals the EOTs of the lower
frequency words. Beyond that point, any increase in prime duration
should no longer lead to increases in the FAE, which should remain at
its maximum magnitude, namely the difference between the EOTs of high-
and low-frequency words (Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}, scenario C).

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{\label{fig-eom-2}Graphic representation of a modification of
the entry opening model, in which the entry opening time may vary as a
function of word frequency. The size of the priming response to a word
is argued to be equal to either the prime duration or the entry opening
time (EOT) of the corresponding lexical entry, whichever is smaller. The
interaction between prime duration and EOT of the prime word may trigger
any of the three scenarios in panels A-C. The length of the black arrow
graphically represents the length of the prime duration; the length and
thickness of the text boxes represent the EOT for each word (shorter for
high-frequency words such as \emph{black}, and longer for low-frequency
words such as \emph{shark}).}

\end{figure}%

Unfortunately, we do not observe this predicted pattern in experiments 1
and 2. In experiment 1, the repetition effect for low-frequency words is
close to the prime duration (a 28ms effect for a 33ms prime duration),
while the repetition effect for high-frequency words is 10ms shorter (a
18ms effect for a 33ms prime duration). If we assume that the LF effect
of 28 ms is not significantly different from the prime duration of 33
ms, our modified \emph{entry opening model} would predict that the prime
duration has not yet exceeded the \emph{opening times} of the low
frequency words, while it clearly has exceeded the \emph{opening times}
of the high-frequency words. Thus, the model just sketched would predict
that an increase in prime duration would also increase the magnitude of
the repetition effect for the LF condition, but not for the HF
condition, leading to a larger FAE (Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}, scenario B).
However, while we did observe a 7ms increase in the magnitude of the
repetition effect for the LF condition in experiment 2
(\(MOP_{exp1}=28ms; MOP_{exp2}=35ms\)), we also observed an 8ms increase
for the HF condition (\(MOP_{exp1}=18ms; MOP_{exp2}=26ms\)), and a FAE
that was virtually identical in magnitude across experiments
(\(FAE_{exp1}=10ms; FAE_{exp2}=9ms\)). Conversely, if we take the
results of experiment 1 at face value, and assume that the 33ms prime
duration exceeds both the \emph{opening times} of high- and
low-frequency words (18 ms and 28 ms, respectively), then the modified
\emph{entry opening model} would indeed make the prediction that the FAE
observed in experiment 1 reveals the maximum of the FAE as 10 ms, and
that this value should not increase when prime duration increases
(Figure~\ref{fig-eom-2}, scenario C). While this is what our experiments
show, the same model would also make the prediction that the repetition
priming effects should remain stable across experiments, contrary to
fact (they are both approximately 8ms longer in experiment 2).

Thus, it seems neither \emph{IA} models nor the modified \emph{entry
opening model} make the correct predictions about the pattern of results
observed in experiments 1 and 2, namely a stable FAE effect irrespective
of prime duration, with a concomitant increase in repetition priming
effects as a function of it. \emph{IA} models would have predicted an
increased FAE in experiment 2, and the modified \emph{entry opening
model} would have predicted either an increased FAE in experiment 2, or
exactly identical results in terms of FAE and repetition priming effects
magnitudes in experiments 1 and 2.

Can these models be amended to allow them to capture the results? On the
one hand, given their core mechanics, \emph{IA} models can capture
either a situation where FAE does not arise (i.e., word frequency is
purely additive to repetition effects), or a situation where FAE is
generated, and its magnitude is necessarily a function of the prime
duration. Neither of these patterns match the results of experiments 1
and 2. So the results of experiment 1 and 2 pose a real challenge for
\emph{IA} models.

On the other hand, a different modification to the original \emph{entry
opening model} may help explain both the existence of the FAE and its
non-interaction with prime duration. If we maintain the assumption that
the EOT is uniform for all words, we could assume that the exposure to
the prime raises the rank order of the target word to the top of the
search list, thus resulting in a ``promotion boost'' that is a function
of the repeated presentation, and should not interact with prime
duration (along the lines of a direction that was already hinted at by
Forster and Davis 1984). This boost would also impact high- and
low-frequency words differently: while both words would benefit from
repetition by being raised to the top of the search list, low-frequency
words would be retrieved comparatively faster than high-frequency words
when contrasted with their first retrieval times during the presentation
of the prime (see Figure~\ref{fig-eom-3}). This simple mechanism
explains at once the existence of the FAE and the fact that it does not
interact with prime duration. For instance, in experiment 1, the 10ms
FAE can be explained as follows: as the EOT is uniform, then it must be
around 18 ms (the repetition priming effect of high-frequency words).
The repetition priming effect for low-frequency words (28 ms) is then
the summation of the EOT (18 ms) and the comparative speed up difference
in retrieval time for the target words across high- and low-frequency
condition (i.e, the FAE, which is 10 ms with our set of materials).

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-eom-3}Graphic representation of an alternative
modification of the entry opening model, in which the lexical entry of
the prime stimulus is promoted to the top of the entry list in the entry
opening stage. As being already relatively high in the list search,
high-frequency prime words (such as \emph{black}) may benefit from the
promotion boost in a lesser extent as compared to low-frequency prime
words (such as \emph{shark}). The differential size of the relative
promotion boost gives rise to the FAE.}

\end{figure}%

Unfortunately, this logic would fail to account for the results of
experiment 2: if the EOT is indeed 18 ms as shown in experiment 1, and
the EOT is the only additional source of priming for high-frequency
words, then this effect is already maxed out with a prime duration of 33
ms. Why is it then that increasing the prime duration to 50 ms in
experiment 2 makes the effect approximately 8ms longer (26 ms)?
\textbf{One potential explanation for this may be that the EOTs may vary
across samples of individuals, in line with a strand of the masked form
priming research showing that priming covaries with the individual
reading and spelling skills of the sample recruited (Andrews and Hersch
2010; Andrews and Lo 2012). In our case, this would mean that the EOT
for the sample in experiment 1 was 18 ms, but it was 26 ms for the
sample in experiment 2, irrespective of the difference in the prime
duration.} The problem with this claim is that it seems arbitrary to
assume that the EOT can vary substantially (here \textasciitilde8 ms)
across our two very large samples, which are able to produce very narrow
margins of errors around precise estimates for a number of relevant
measurements, such as the mean and standard deviations RT for the
unrelated conditions and non-word conditions and the magnitude of the
FAE. Nonetheless, it may be a fruitful avenue for future studies to
explore.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Our study successfully replicated and expanded upon the work of Angele
et al. (2023), Cayado, Wray, and Stockall (2023) and Petrosino, Sprouse,
and Almeida (2023), confirming the viability of observing repetition
priming effects in masked priming experiments conducted online with both
a short (33ms) and longer (50ms) priming durations. Notably, we were
able to successfully address a lingering empirical question in the
literature by establishing that the Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE)
does arises under masked conditions. We were able to determine
additionally that the FAE is also independent of the duration of the
prime. We contend that, while this pattern of results presents a direct
challenge to both \emph{IA} and \emph{entry opening} models, the latter
offers a few promising avenues for small modifications might enable it
to accommodate the results of our studies. The most promising is the
assumption that after the encounter with the prime, its entry is
temporarily raised to the top of the rank frequency ordered search list.
This modification explains at once the existence of the FAE, and its
independence of the prime duration.

\textbf{(Here's my attempt to add some general implications of the
results of the study:) While our findings present a compelling case for
the presence of FAE in masked priming that is seemingly parallel to the
unmasked case, questions about potential mechanistic differences
persist. First, the larger sample size needed to detected the masked FAE
raises intriguing considerations about the influence of memory sources,
and warrants further investigation. For example, there is independent
evidence for different mechanisms in masked and unmasked repetition
priming from RT distributional analyses that suggests that repetition
priming under masked conditions affect primarily the encoding stage of
the stimulus (Gomez, Perea, and Ratcliff 2013). Given that frequency is
often associated with facilitation of encoding, our results could help
support this view. Additionally, the trivially small inhibitory effect
sizes of non-word masked repetition priming in experiments 1 and 2 align
with the trend (overwhelmingly shown in the literature) that
facilitatory effect may be exclusive to unmasked designs (Forster 1998;
Forster, Mohan, and Hector 2003; but see Masson and Bodner 2003), and
suggests avenues for future exploration. Finally, the finding that the
FAE occurs under masked priming conditions may impact our understanding
of masked morphological priming. In this literature, there is a
unresolved question about the ability of affixes to elicit masked
morphological priming results (for a review, Amenta and Crepaldi 2012).
In English, the evidence seems to indicate that only stems, but not
affixes, have the ability to prime entries across the lexicon. This
finding can and has been used to support models in which affixes are
initially stripped before stems are accessed in the lexicon (Taft and
Forster 1975; Forster and Azuma 2000; Stockall and Marantz 2006).
However, stems and affixes do also have a large frequency imbalance,
with most affixes being substantially more frequent that most stems. The
observation of FAE under masked priming can provide an alternative
reason for why masked stem morphological priming is well attested, but
masked affix morphological priming is not: the latter could be due to a
ceiling frequency attenuation effect. This is an intriguing possibility
that we anticipate to be fruitful to explore in the near future.}
